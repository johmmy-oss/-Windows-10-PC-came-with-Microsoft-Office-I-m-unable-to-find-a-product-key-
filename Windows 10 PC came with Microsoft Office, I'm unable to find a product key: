The first thing you should check for is if you see a screen that says Letâ€™s Get Started. It should also be giving you options to try, buy, or activate Microsoft Office. 

What this screen means is that the Microsoft Office program that is installed on your PC is only there as a 1-month trial of Office 365 Home. 

This also means that you will not be receiving a product key from your PC manufacturer unless you paid for an Office product key card. 

To combat this issue, you can either buy Microsoft Office or start up a trial of Office 365 Home. 

However, if you have paid for an Office product to be already included on your new Windows 10 PC, then a digital product key is automatically placed on your PC after you activate Windows 10. 

Instead of receiving a printed product key, you will see a message that is similar to the one you see when you start up Word or any other Office application.  office.com/setup or microsoft.com
